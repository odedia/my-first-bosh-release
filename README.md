# My First BOSH release

This is a git repo to teach the basics of creating a bosh release. You can write it yourself by following the video from CF Summit by Rebecca Putinski & Peter Tran at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXbHepMNhZY, and use this as reference. Included as an example here is a full `manifest.yml` (you'll probably need to edit it a bit for your own environment).
